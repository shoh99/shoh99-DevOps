                <p>Sitting on the high cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, DevOps offers a sublime slice of modern minimalism on the Mediterranean, with an emphasis on elegant simplicity and first-rate food.
                    An airy refuge, our boutique 42-room hotel is a place where guests can rediscover the forgotten rhythms of long, drawn-out days and easy, lingering evenings. 
                    Our hotel serves as a sanctuary, bearing a fresh, pared-back aesthetic and a white-on-white palette that accentuates both the sea and sky blues outside and the contemporary artworks on display inside.</p>

                    Understated chic is our design ethos and subtle details are our raison d’être: we like to make sure everything is immaculate, from the pillowy and pristine white Etro cotton sheets dressing your bed right down to the carefully placed garnish of garden-grown herbs on your plate.

                <p>   The staff were very approachable and helpful. The breakfast was good. They arranged for a taxi to pick us up from the airport and then back again at the end of our stay. The suite was very good with comfortable furniture and the bed was comfortable too. We would definitely stay here again.

               <p>  The hotel stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful, the location was very convenient for getting around and many activities. If we were to travel to Prague again, we would definitely stay there again!</p>

               <p> loved the location and the breakfast (including the timing!) Would definitely stay here again! :) P.s. if you could only look at installing a laundry room would be epic as there are no Laundromats within the vicinity of Old Town. :)</p>
